# Hello_World


I am currently a junior at the University of Iowa. I am a majoring in Business Analytics and Accounting. I have been mainly been focusing on Accounting so far as that is the industry with which I am more interested in. I am from Naperville, Illinois and I hope to someday find a job in the city of Chicago.
